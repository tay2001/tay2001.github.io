MART 441 - HW 2
This week was pretty light, and I had no issue completing it. I have implemented many JS scripts before on other
web projects like an ECommerce store, Django projects, etc.. Overall, implementing and getting a quick refresher
on implementing a script and thinking of the cultural importance of my favorite artists was a nice change of pace
and I enjoyed this week. I am excited to get into more complex JS.
