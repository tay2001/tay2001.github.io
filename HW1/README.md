441 HW-1 Readme
This assignment was a fun, brief throwback into HTML/CSS. I am taking
MART341 this semester as well, but I believe with my knowledge from my
CS courses I should succeed well in both courses. Looking at the live
example, I really enjoyed the opening hero image and text-block on
Michael's page and did my best to recreate that with the Nav bar.

I then added my own information in the 3 breaks that corresponded with
my information about me, my future plans, and where to find me on the web.
I looked on W3 schools for the fonts for the logos of companies for my 
Find Me section and used those accordingly for my third section.

I believe I made a simple and nice webpage and I hope to improve upon it
throughout the semester.
