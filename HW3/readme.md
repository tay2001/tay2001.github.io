MART 441 - 1/30/23
This week was still a bit chill for me. Using the onclick events and getting elementids wasn't something new for me, but it was a nice refresher. 
I utilized some prior skills of hover events for my buttons, and utilized my content box from the very first assignment. As for inspiration, I used my old beagle Sheldon.
The photo is not him, however.
